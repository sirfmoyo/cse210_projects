# Student Marks Evaluation Program using C-sharp

# Title: Student Marks Evaluation Program



## Objective:
The Student Marks Evaluation Program's goal is to develop a user-friendly console programme for quickly computing and assessing students' final marks based on their performance on written assignments and the weight assigned to those assignments. It will use Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism to implement the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.


## Abstraction:
The programme will utilise abstraction to conceal from the user the complexity of the mark calculation. In order to express typical behaviours and properties, such as Paper and Subject, abstract classes and interfaces will be defined. Abstraction enables us to concentrate on key features while hiding implementation details, giving users a user interface that is clean and straightforward.

## Inheritance:
By establishing a hierarchy between classes, inheritance will make it easier to reuse code. Because subjects are made up of many papers, the Subject class, for instance, can inherit attributes and methods from the Paper class. This reduces duplication and guarantees a better structured class structure.

## Polymorphism: 
Using standard interfaces and procedures, the programme will be able to handle several forms of papers (such as multiple-choice, essay-style, etc.). This dynamic behaviour increases the program's flexibility and scalability by enabling it to handle various paper kinds without changing the main logic.

The Student Marks Evaluation Programme will demonstrate the power of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism by embracing these OOP principles, making it a superb illustration of best practises in contemporary software development.
